This repository powers my personal website: [matt-whitehead.com](https://www.matt-whitehead.com).

It is based on the [Identity](https://html5up.net/identity) template provided by HTML5 UP under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). The site serves as merely a landing page for now, but I hope to expand it in the future. 

The main purpose of the site is to dive into Continuious Deployment. This repo powers an [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) workflow. Commits to the prod branch automatically trigger a build and deploy workflow which pushes changes live to [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) within minutes.

A pretty fun little side project and a nice intro to CI/CD :)
